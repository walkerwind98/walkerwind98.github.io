												<h4>Thule Clamp Testing Machine</h4>
												<h5>June - August 2020</h5>
												<p>In order to automate the compression testing of a clamp, I designed a machine that will be used
													on the factory floor to  assure the quality of products before they are sold. The machine uses a motor, 
													which is lowered onto the clamp by the user, to twist the knob on the clamp and close the jaws to a specified compression force. 
													The testing block that is being grabbed by the clamp contains a load cell, that tells the user how much force the clamp is applying.
													</p>
												<p> I designed this machine for my 2020 summer internship with Zephyr Lock. I used SolidWorks 
													to create a 3D model for the machine and solidify the concept for the prototype.
													I designed the machine to be cost-effective, user-friendly, and safe to use. 
													I fabricated the custom parts for the prototype using various machine shop tools.

												<h4>Self Playing Violin</h4>
												<h5>June - December 2019</h5>
												<p>This project, which I began working on in June 2019, is tasked with creating
													a violin that can be controlled autonomously. In developing this working prototype
													that can be later carried to market, I have learned about troubleshooting,
													designing a system, and rapid prototyping. The majority of my contribution has been
													to developing the controls and electronics to act in concert with the physical
													motion of the violin bow. </p>

												<h4>Cirrus Lock System</h4>
												<h5>June - August 2020</h5>
												<p>As part of my 2020 summer internship, I was tasked with conducting a usability 
													study on the Cirrus Lock system, an cloud-connected 
													electronic lock system designed specifically for lockers. 
													For the engineering team at Zephyr Lock, I provided feedback 
													on all of the features of the system, found bugs in the current
													 platform, and tested the performance of the system.  </p>

												<h4>Robotics Projects</h4>
												<h5>January - May 2020</h5>
												<p>Over the course of a semester, I used Lego EV3 Robotics kits to create 
													several robots. These robots accomplished several different tasks, 
													and were used to help teach me about sensors, coding interfaces, 
													machine learning, kinematics, and rapid prototyping.  
													The following pictures show robots that accomplished 
													several different tasks. </p>

												<h4>Brass Acid Bleed Project</h4>
												<h5>June - August 2019</h5>
												<p>As part of a Mechanical Engineering Internship at the Tufts Center for Engineering
													Education and Outreach, I conducted a scientific study to determine the origin 
													of a defect that affects the manufacturing of trombones at a major instrument 
													manufacturer.  In order to understand what was causing the reaction, I designed tests
													to eliminate variables in the reaction, gathered information about the factory 
													conditions and processes, and documented my theories and results. </p>
													 <p>In order to 
													conduct research on brass samples, I constructed my own humidity chamber. 
													This design integrated humidity sensors with a fan system that allows for 
													the user to regulate the humidity at which materials are tested. The casing 
													and hinge was designed in SolidWorks, and cut using a laser cutter. The 
													electro-mechanical system is powered using a Raspberry Pi, using Python 
													libraries to create a Flask server that hosts a local website to 
													display statistics about the temperature and humidity.</p>

												<h4>Lego Wall-E</h4>
												<h5>January - May 2020</h5>
												<p>Under the guidance of Professor Chris Rogers, a friend and I 
													designed and built a small robot resembling Pixar's Wall-E
													 robot that was piloted using a chest-mounted controller suit. 
													 The controller used gyroscopic sensors to control the motion of 
													 the robot.
													 I coded the robot using the Lego EV3 microPython libraries. </p>

												<h4>Cornhole Data Analysis</h4>
												<h5>March - May 2020</h5>
												<p>For my Instruments and Experimentation class, I used 
													video processing software and data analysis to analyze 
													my ability to play cornhole. My group and I studied all 
													of the measurable variables that went into a cornhole throw,
													 the throwing performance over time, and the error that was 
													 generated by the video analysis software. To investigate all of
													  these topics, I used a sports video analysis software, Kinovea, to
													   generate metrics on each cornhole throw. I used Matlab code to
													    process the data collected on each of the
													 cornhole throws and provide quanititative results on each of the topics we studied. </p>

												<h4>Self-Driving Cars Technical Paper</h4>
												<h5>April 2020</h5>
												<p>For my Technical and Managerial Communications class, I wrote a research paper on autonomous cars,
													 a topic that has always interested me. This in-depth research paper
													  can be used as a writing sample. After the paper, I provided 
													  an oral presentation on the topic to go along with the paper. </p>

												<h4>SolidWorks Associate Certification</h4>
												<h5>May 2020</h5>
												<p>During the first months of quarantine for Covid-19, I found 
													myself with some extra time to develop my skills with SOLIDWORKS.
													 I spent a few hours every day practicing making parts and assemblies for a few weeks. 
													 Soon thereafter, I successfully received my 
													Associate's certification for Mechanical Design in SOLIDWORKS.  </p>

												<h4>Self-Playing Chess Board</h4>
												<h5>January 2018 - Present</h5>
												<p>This passion project began simply with
													 the idea of 3-D printing my own chess pieces.
													  From then on, I have been working on developing 
													  a chess board that uses an x-y motor system to move 
													  the chess pieces by themself.  After developing the 
													  first prototype sophomore year, I have since rebuilt 
													  the table that held the machine to be more compact
													   and fit the design of a pre-built x-y plotter kit. </p>

												<h4>Tufts ASME</h4>
												<h5>September 2018 - Present</h5>
												<p> Since spring of 2018, I have been the President of the Tufts
													chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. 
													As the president of the club, I lead a team of students that organizes events to give
													Mechanical Engineering majors the tools to have a successful academic and professional career.

													In addition to career prep workshops, we also host social events to help students in the department to get to know one another and the faculty. 
												</p>
												<p> In the spring of 2020, I was very humbled to receive the Vincent Manno Leadership Award for my contributions to the club and the Mechanical Engineering department. 
													This award is given to a student for demonstrating vision, communication skills, and an ability to motivate and lead a team to achieve specific objectives under various resource constraints. 
													I am very grateful to be able to work on such a mission-driven, cohesive team for these past couple years and 
													to get to give back to the close-knit community of the Tufts Mechanical Engineering department.

												<h4>Nolop Makerspace</h4>
												<h5>September 2019 - Present</h5>
												<p> Since the fall of 2019, I have worked as a Fabrication Supervisor in the Nolop Makerspace at Tufts. 
													Through this job and through working on many projects in the makerspace, I learned how to use 
													3D printing and lasercutting to create prototypes. In addition to these digital fabrication methods, I 
													developed skills in woodworking, robotics, and coding. One of my favorite parts of this job has been
													teaching other students how to use machines and build their own projects.
